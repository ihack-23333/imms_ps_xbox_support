# imms_ps_xbox_support

Internal changes to the imms wheelbase program, adding support for ps and xbox, which can be used for wheelbase to adapt to ps and xbox

*Connect the DualShock 4 to the usb port on the back of the wheelbase, reboot the wheelbase and connect to the PS4 to simulate a steering wheel
*Connect a third party wired only to the usb port on the back of the wheelbase, reboot the wheelbase and connect to the PS5 to simulate a steering wheel

*In the future, it will also support connecting an xbox controller to support xbox



Note that different models of wheelbases need to match different programs, otherwise the wheelbases may not be used normally
