# imms_ps_xbox_support


### Contentsü§ó

Internal changes to the imms wheelbase program, adding support for ps and xbox, which can be used for wheelbase to adapt to ps and xbox.

By calling the authentication of the ps controller, the imms wheelbase can be used on the ps platform.

In the future, it will also support connecting an xbox controller to support xbox.



### Step by stepüòÉ

* 1 Base firmware update via immplatform->base->misc->update->local update.Note that different models of wheelbases need to match different programs, otherwise the wheelbases may not be used normally.

* 2.1 For ps4,connect the DualShock 4 to the usb port on the back of the wheelbase, reboot the wheelbase and connect to the ps4.

* 2.2 For ps4 or ps5,connect a third party wired only PS4 controller (<i> only hori ps4 mini pad is supported now </i>) to the usb port on the back of the wheelbase, reboot the wheelbase and connect to the ps4 or ps5.

* 3 Requires an imms official compatible pedal to be connected to the wheelbase expansion port, otherwise you'll have no accelerator and no brakes


* 4 PlayÔºÅ


### About the experience üòé

When the wheelbases is in ps mode, it will automatically use the preset optimal force feedback settings.

Note that the authentication PS controller(DualShock 4 or hori ps4 mini pad) must be connected, otherwise the base will be disconnected in about 8 minutes.

More authentication controllers will be supported in the future, welcome to Star or Fork the project to get the latest version in time.

This project will be updated with the official imms update to ensure access to the latest features.

This project is an open source firmware project. If you have any questions or needs, please submit an issue.
