# imms_ps_xbox_support



Internal changes to the imms wheelbase program, adding support for ps and xbox, which can be used for wheelbase to adapt to ps and xbox.

By calling the authentication of the ps controller, the imms wheelbase can be used on the ps platform.

In the future, it will also support connecting an xbox controller to support xbox.
