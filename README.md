# imms_ps_xbox_support


### Contentsü§ó

Internal changes to the imms wheelbase program, adding support for ps and xbox, which can be used for wheelbase to adapt to ps and xbox.

By calling the authentication of the ps controller, the imms wheelbase can be used on the ps platform.

In the future, it will also support connecting an xbox controller to support xbox.



### Step by stepüòÉ

* 1 Base firmware update via immplatform->base->misc->update->local update.Note that different models of wheelbases need to match different programs, otherwise the wheelbases may not be used normally.

* 2.1 Connect the DualShock 4 to the usb port on the back of the wheelbase, reboot the wheelbase and connect to the PS4.

* 2.2 Connect a third party wired only PS4 controller (<i> only hori ps4 mini pad is supported now </i>) to the usb port on the back of the wheelbase, reboot the wheelbase and connect to the PS5.

* 3 PlayÔºÅ


### About the experience üòé

When the wheelbases is in ps mode, it will automatically use the preset optimal force feedback settings.

At present, it is a device that is simulated as a gear transmission, so the feel can be further improved by updating. Welcome to Star or Fork the project to get the latest version in time.
